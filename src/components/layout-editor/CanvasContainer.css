/* Optional: If we want to ensure the existing padding/border are not overridden
   by the order of class application, we can be more specific or add them here.
   However, Tailwind CSS usually handles this well.
   If bg-gray-50 needs to be overridden by #f0f0f0, this should work.
   If not, we might need !important or adjust Tailwind class removal.
